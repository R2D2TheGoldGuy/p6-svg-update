#Project 6 - SVG Update


Main Objective: Optimize a web page by replacing png files with scalable vector graphics. You'll be given a website with rasterized images (PNG Files) along with matching SVG files, you'll need to replace the rasterized images and modernize the UI using the SVGs. Bonus points if you can try to avoid adding the .svg extension and instead directly embedding the svg to your html code for better optimization and configuration.

Note: These projects are intended to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement the designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
